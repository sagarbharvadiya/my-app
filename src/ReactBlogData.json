            "dis": "React Hooks simplify the codebase by replacing class components with functional components. This shift results in more readable and maintainable code, which is a significant advantage for end-users. It means that future updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements can be implemented more efficiently, reducing long-term maintenance costs."

This consistency is crucial for end-users as it ensures a uniform user experience and reduces the likelihood of state-related bugs."
